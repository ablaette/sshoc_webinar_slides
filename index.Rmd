# Corpora everywhere. 

## But where do we stand?

--

There is no lack ...

- of algorithms
- of ideas and projects on research data management (implementing FAIR data principles)

But ...

--

* Acquisition of NLP techniques in the social sciences & humanities still piecemeal

--

* Tools for processing text that scale well are lacking

--

* Availability of data for replication is missing 

--

* Reproducibility of data (getting FAIRER) is wanting

--

* __Integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches to text is an unfulfilled promise__

# Theory is Code
## The "quanlification" frontier

# From text to numbers

## The idea of "distant reading"

- "[…] the trouble with close reading […] is that it necessarily depends on an extremely small canon. […] what we really need is a little pact with the devil: we know how to read texts, so now let‘s learn how not to read them. Distant reading, where distance, let me repeat is, is a condition of knowledge. It allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, types – or genres and systems. And if, between the very small and the very large, the text itself disappears, well, this is one of the cases where one can justifiably say, Less is more.“ (Moretti [2000] 2013: 49)


## The "text as data" movement:

- scaling party positions (wordscore and wordfish) as a driver
-"[…] while our method is designed to analyse the content of a text, it is not necessary for an analyst using the technique to understand, or even read, the texts to which the technique is applied. " (Laver, Benoit & Garry 2003)

# Text + Numbers = Quanlification

## An obsolete methodological divide?

.pull-left[

### Quantity

- Text as Data
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data / Text Mining
- Machine Learning (ML)
- "Validate, validate, validate" (Grimmer et al. 2013)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Quality
- eHumanities / Digital Humanities
- Corpus Linguistics 
- Computational Linguistics
- "blended reading" (Stulpe, Lemke 2015), "scalable reading" (Weitin 2017) & related concepts
]

--

### Quanlification

- Epistemological disputes notwithstanding: The necessity to combine qualitative and quantitative approaches to text is conceptually undisputed.

- Software inhibits combining quantity and quality: Tools are there, but setting up a quanlitative project is expensive: Difficult without a dedicated software engineer

# Verbs and nouns for corpus analysis

## polmineR: A basic vocabulary for quanlification

- __Corpora and subcorpora__
  - corpus objects: *corpus()*
  - subsetting corpora: *partition()* / *subset()*

--

- __Quantification__
  - counting: *hits()*, *count()*, *dispersion()* (and *size()*)
  - cooccurrences: *cooccuurrences()*, *Cooccurrences()*
  - feature extraction: *features()*
  - term-document-matrices: *as.sparseMatrix()*, *as.TermDocumentMatrix()*

--

- __Qualitative analysis__
  - Keywords-in-context / concordances: *kwic()*
  - full text (of a subcorpus): *get_token_stream()*, *as.markdown()*, *as.html()*, *read()*

# Implementing Quanlification 
## Let's Get Things Done

---

# Reading Anywhere: 'fulltext' htmlwidget

## Problem Statement

- **Read Anything:** Cooccurrences, concordances, subcorpora, topic models - there are many different scenarios when you 
- **Read Anywhere:** Include fulltext output into (html) documents and slides, and in GUIs


## Implementation

- polmineR vocabulary: Implementation of a `read()`-method
- GUI: Package 'fulltext' that renders input data into an "htmlwidget" (a truly flexible device)

## Demonstration

- HTML documents with scrollable fulltext [click here for an example](file:///Users/andreasblaette/Lab/github/fulltext/docs/articles/vignette.html#from-a-subcorpus-to-fulltext)
- Slides with `fulltext` htmlwidget [click here for an example](https://polmine.github.io/gallery/crosstalk_ioslides.html#1)
- polmineR shiny App [click here for an example]()


---

# Highlighting and Tooltipping

## Problem Statement

- **Highlighting with multiple colors:** The statistical analysis of text yields variable dictionaries with word weights - visualising multiple dictionaries at the same time will help to gather the semantic sense of numeric analyses
- **Tooltipping :** Colors alone may be misleading. Show numeric information on demand


## Implementation

- polmineR level: Implementation of methods `highlight()` and `tooltips()`
- GUI: Enrich input data for htmlwidgets and amend CSS

## Demonstration

- Validating sentiment analyses with interactive KWIC tables [example]()
- Evaluate topic models with flexdashboard [example]()
- Understanding the data behind cooccurrence graphs [example](https://polmine.github.io/gcdh_slides/widget_3.html)

---


# Annotation

## Problem Statement

- **Annotation and intersubjectivity**: In the qualitative research tradition, annotations are a means to communicate evaluative decisions to other researchers
- **Annotation and machine learning** Annotations (generating labelled data) are a precondition for machine learning


## Implementation

- polmineR level: Implementation of `edit()`-methods 
- Htmlwidget with annotation functionality (different from `fulltext` htmlwidget, as it returns values)

## Demonstration

- Annotate any class inheriting from the `textstat` class (i.e. tables - kwic, cooccurrences, features)
- Simple text annotation with the `annolite` package
- Annotate cooccurrence graphs [example](https://polmine.github.io/gcdh_slides/widget_3.html)

---

# Annotation

- Code Example: Annotate a cooccurrences object

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(polmineR)
s <- cooccurrences("UNGA", "sustainability") # could also be kwic etc.
annotations(s) <- list(name = "annotation", what = "")
edit(s)
```

- Code Example: Annotate fulltext

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(polmineR)
library(annolite) # at github.com/PolMine/annolite, dev-branch

data <- corpus("GERMAPARLMINI") %>%
  subset(speaker == "Volker Kauder") %>% 
  subset(date == "2009-11-10") %>%
  as("partition") %>%
  as.fulltextdata(headline = "Volker Kauder (CDU)")
anno <- annotate(data)
```

# The Making of a Quanlification Toolset

## Conscious Uncoupling and Modularization

- [*fulltext*](https://github.com/PolMine/fulltext):<br/>Toolset to generate fulltext display from corpus data

- [*gradget*](https://github.com/PolMine/gradget):<br/>Graph annotation widget

- [*annolite*](https://github.com/PolMine/annolite):<br/>Leightweight Fulltext Display and Annotation Tools

- [*topicanalysis*](https://github.com/PolMine/topicanalysis):<br/>Auxiliary functions for topicmodelling.

- [*quanlify*](https://github.com/PolMine/quanlify):<br>Toolset for the qualitative validation of quantitative text analysis

**Beware! All of this is experimental!**


---

# Discussion. Frontier.

## Vision

- Offer a very flexible set of tools to implement all kinds of workflows that entail distant and close reading with minimal cost
- A **l**eightweight **i**nfrastructure for the **qu**anlitat**i**ve analysis of text **d**ata ("liquid")

--

## Inspiration from the Unix philosophy

- keep it simple, stupid (KISS)
- parsimony (leave as much as possible to existing libraries)
- modularity (identify independent building blocks and develop them soundly)

--

## Discussion Points

- Alternative approaches, relevant previous work
- How much GUI is needed?
- Toolset of framework?
- Towards a people's framework for quanlification?

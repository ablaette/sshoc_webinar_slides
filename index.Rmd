## Focus of the presentation

- Combining close and distant and close reading [@Moretti2013] is an unfulfilled promise: Software often inhibits combining both perspectives. How to implement workflows for coding and annotating textual data?

- Scenarios: 
  - flexdashboards: 
  - Shiny Modules: 
  - Gradgets: Interactive graph annotation as an approach to generate intersubjectively shared interpretations/understandings of discourse patterns.

With forces all arrayed;
If in my heart I do not yield,
I'll overcome some day.

# Theory is Code
## Ideas behind "quanlification"

---


## From text to numbers {.smaller}

- __from computer-assisted content analysis to "text as data"__<br/>
  scaling party positions as a driver (wordscore and wordfish)
- __joyful blasphemy agains reading ...__<br/>"[…]because it treats words simply as data rather than requiring any knowledge of their meaning as used in the text, our word scoring method works irrespective of the language in which the texts are written. In other words, while our method is designed to analyse the content of a text, it is not necessary for an analyst using the technique to understand, or even read, the texts to which the technique is applied. The primary advantage of this feature is that the technique can be applied to texts in any language." (Laver, Benoit & Garry 2003)
- __common methods and applications__
  - sentiment analyses
  - topic modelling (unsupervised learning)
  - classification (cp. Comparative Agendas Project / CAP)
- __"Validate, validate, validate" (Grimmer et al. 2013)__<br/>An (almost) unheard plea

## The idea of "distant reading" {.smaller}

„[…] the trouble with close reading […] is that it necessarily depends on an extremely small canon. […] you invest in individual texts so much only if you think that very few of them really matter. […] if you want to look beyond the canon […], close reading will not do it. […] At the bottom it‘s a theological exercise – very solemn treatment of very few texts taken very seriously – whereas what we really need is a little pact with the devil: we know how to read texts, so now let‘s learn how not to read them. Distant reading, where distance, let me repeat is, is a condition of knowledge. It allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, types – or genres and systems. And if, between the very small and the very large, the text itself disappears, well, this is one of the cases where one can justifiably say, Less is more. If we want to understand the system in its entirety, we must accept loosing something. We always pay a price for theoretical knowledge; concepts are abstract, are poor. But it‘s precisely this poverty that makes it possible to handle them, and therefore to know.  This is why less is actually more.“ (Moretti [2000] 2013: 49)

# Scenario III
## Graph Annotation Widgets: Gradgets

## Problem: The elusive merit of cooccurrence graphs

* Popularity of cooccurrence graphs [@Rhizome2013; @2016TMid].

- Suggestive visualisations ... But are these interpretations sound and do they meet standards of intersubjectivity? 
  - The graph layout depends heavily on filter decisions.
  - Filtering is necessary, but there are difficulties to justify filter decisions. 
  - Graph visualisation implies many possibilities to provide extra information, but there are perils of information overload.
  - If we try to omit filter decisions, we run into the problem of overwhelming complexity of large graphs.
  - How to handle the complexity and create the foundations for intersubjectivity? 


## Gradgets

So 'gradgets' are the solution suggested here.  The links to the following three gradgets offer a visualisation that is interactive in a double sense:

(a) You can turn the visualisation in three-dimensional space
(b) You can click on the edges and nodes, get the concordances that are behind the statistical evaluation, and leave an annotation.

In a real-world workflow, the result of the graph annotation exercise can be stored and put into an online appendix to a publication that explains interpretative results.

So these are the gradgets:

* [threedimensional gradget I](https://polmine.github.io/gcdh_slides/widget_1.html)
* [threedimensional, anaglyph gradget II](https://polmine.github.io/gcdh_slides/widget_2.html)
* [threedimensional, anaglyph gradget III (restrictive filtering)](https://polmine.github.io/gcdh_slides/widget_3.html)
